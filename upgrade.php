/**
 * Upgrade functions for iadlearning module
 *
 * All the core Moodle functions needed to allow the module to work integrated in Moodle, should be placed here.
 * All the iad specific functions, needed to implement all the module logic, should go to locallib.php. 
 * This will help to save some memory when Moodle is performing actions across all modules.
